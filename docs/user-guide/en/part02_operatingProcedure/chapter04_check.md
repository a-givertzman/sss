## Periodic checks
During the annual, interim and renewal inspection on board the ship in the presence of an inspector of the classification society or in other necessary case, the on-board software is checked using test calculations corresponding to the documentation on the stability of the vessel. The results of the test calculations approved by the classification society are supplied together with the documentation for the software. The download cases specified in the software, corresponding to the test calculations, are stored in the program archive together with the rest of the cases and are protected from writing and deletion.
