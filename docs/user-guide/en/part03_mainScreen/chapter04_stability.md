## A field with a circular stability indicator
A circular stability indicator is shown in the middle part on the right. The indicator shows the value of the corrected metacentric height.
<!-- TODO: уточнить после реализации -->
If stability is not provided for the current loading case (at least one of the stability criteria is not met), the scale is highlighted in red.

More detailed information on the stability of the vessel can be found on the page ["Stability"](/docs/user-guide/en/part08_stability/part08_stability.md).
