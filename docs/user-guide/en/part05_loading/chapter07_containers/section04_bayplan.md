### Description of the bay plan
At the top of the screen there is a bay plan, which is designed in accordance with ISO 9711-1 part 1.
The "section-row-tier" system has been adopted for the placement of containers. The format of the container placement code is BBRRTT, where BB is a section, RR is a row, TT is a tier.

#### Section 
Numbering from bow to stern. Odd numbers are accepted for numbering 20-foot containers. For 40-footers, even ones. 30-foot ones are indicated by even numbers with a "*" sign. 

In the case of mixed stacking of two 20-foot containers in a 40-foot compartment, the aft 20-foot container is shown on the plan of the 40-foot compartment, while the 20-foot container is shown on the plan of a separate compartment having the previous odd number in seniority. 

For a plan that accommodates only 20-foot containers, the even section is enclosed in brackets. For mixed plans or in which only 40-footers are placed, the odd section is enclosed in brackets. 

The plans are scrolled by clicking on the line with the plan numbers located under the section plans.

To the right of the bay plan is the total number of containers in the hold and on deck in each section.

#### Row
Numbering from the diametrical plane. The rows of containers located on the ship to the right of the CL are numbered with odd numbers, on the left with even numbers. If the number of rows is odd, the row located in the CL is numbered 00.

#### Tier
Numbering of containers from the bottom. Containers located in the hold are numbered from 02, standing directly on the main deck are numbered 80, and those standing on hatches are numbered from 82. With each tier, 2 is added to the figure. The numbering scheme of the tiers remains unchanged, even if containers are loaded with a height other than the standard one.
