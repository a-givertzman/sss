### Loading of containers

The container is selected by clicking on the corresponding container from the list or (if it is installed on the ship) from the bay plane. To load the container, select the container from the list and the installation location, and then click "Load container". You can also load the selected container by double-clicking on an empty space.
If you select a container from the general list, you can place it in the available installation locations. At the same time, the following restrictions on the installation of containers apply:
- installation of a shorter container on a longer container (20- or 30-foot by 40-foot) is not allowed; 
- the number of containers installed in one stack depends on the height of the containers and is limited by the permissible height of the stack;
- when installing a 40-foot container on a container of a shorter length, it is assumed that it is installed on one side on an overpass, the overpasses are highlighted in brown;
- when installing a 40-foot container on two containers of shorter length with different heights, the installation height of the 40-foot container is determined by the higher height of the lower containers. The second side assumes that the container is installed on an overpass, which is also highlighted in brown;
- when removing a container from the lower tier, on which the container(s) is already installed, it is assumed that it is replaced by an overpass of a similar height, which is also highlighted in brown.

After assigning a place to the container, its center of gravity coordinates are determined automatically. The center of gravity of each container in height, length and width is taken at its center. When determining the center of gravity by height, separation between containers is taken into account, as well as separation of the lower container from the deck of the installation. When containers are installed on deck, the windage and icing of the deck cargo of containers are taken into account in the calculation, and the criterion "Roll from circulation" is calculated.

To unload containers, select a container and click unload container. It is also possible to unload the container by right-clicking on it. Additionally, it is possible to unload all loaded containers, for this you need to click on the clear plan button.
