## Table with landing criteria
The criteria table provides a summary of information on the fulfillment of the landing criteria required for the vessel:
- name of the criterion with dimension;
- its calculated value;
- fulfillment condition (more/less);
- acceptable value;
- the status of the criterion fulfillment for the current download.
  
The list of calculated criteria is given in the table. The list of criteria to be applied to the vessel, depending on the specified cargo, is determined automatically. The criteria are calculated in accordance with the rules of the classification society:
