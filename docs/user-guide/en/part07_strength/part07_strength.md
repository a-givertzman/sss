The Strength page is designed to display the results of calculating shear forces and bending moments and compare them with acceptable values and consists of graphs and tables of bending moments (in the upper part) and shear forces (in the lower part) accordingly.

The data are given for spacings evenly distributed along the length of the vessel. The tables for each location show:
| Name of the parameter | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| " Value" | Calculated values of bending moments and shearing forces. The values are also displayed on the charts as histograms |
| "Lower limit", "Top limit" | Upper and lower permissible limits. The values are also displayed on the charts with orange limits |
| "Acceptable" | The percentage of the calculated value of the acceptable value
 
The rows in the table can be sorted in ascending or descending order by the values of each column, the sorting mode for the column changes when you click on its header.
