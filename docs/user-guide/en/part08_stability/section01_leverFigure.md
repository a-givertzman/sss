## Stability curves graph
The graph of stability curves shows:
- line static stability curve (SSC);
- line dynamic stability curve (DSC);
- line initial stability $h$.

The stability curves is plotted towards the initial roll of $\theta_0$. The direction of the graph is indicated in the title. The graph also shows the values:
- the initial roll of the vessel $\theta_0$;
- the roll of the vessel is equal to $\theta_0+1rad$;
- corrected initial metacentric height of $h$.
When you hover over the graph field, the value for each curve is displayed for each roll angle in increments of 1 degree.
