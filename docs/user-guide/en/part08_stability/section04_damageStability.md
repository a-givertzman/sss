## Damage stability
The assessment of damage stability is performed by comparing the corrected metacentric height $h$ for the current loading case with the minimum allowable metacentric height of division into compartments $h_{sub}$ for the current displacement (or draft). The damage stability for the current loading case is considered satisfactory if the condition $h\geq h_{sub}$ is met. The result of calculating the corrected metacentric height, the minimum allowable metacentric height of the division into compartments, as well as the status of the criterion is given in the stability criteria table.
